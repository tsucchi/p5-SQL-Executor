NAME
    SQL::Executor - Thin DBI wrapper using SQL::Maker

SYNOPSIS
      use DBI;
      use SQL::Executor;
      my $dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $id, $pass);
      my $ex = SQL::Executor->new($dbh);
      my @rows = $ex->select('SOME_TABLE', { id => 123 });
      $ex->insert('SOME_TABLE', { id => 124, value => 'xxxx'} );
      $ex->update('SOME_TABLE', { value => 'yyyy'}, { id => 124 } );
      $ex->delete('SOME_TABLE', { id => 124 } );

DESCRIPTION
    SQL::Executor is thin DBI wrapper using SQL::Maker. This module provides
    interfaces to make easier access to SQL.

    You can execute SQL via SQL::Maker-like interface in select(),
    select_row(), select_all(), select_with_fields(),
    select_row_with_fields(), select_all_with_fields(), insert(),
    insert_multi(), update() and delete().

    If you want to use more complex select query, you can use
    select_named(), select_row_named() or select_all_named() these execute
    SQL with named placeholder. If you don't want to use named placeholder,
    you can use select_by_sql(), select_row_by_sql() or select_all_by_sql()
    these execute SQL with normal placeholder('?').

METHODS
  new($dbh, $option_href)
    $dbh: Database Handler $option_href: option

    available option is as follows

    allow_empty_condition (BOOL default 1): allow empty condition(where) in
    select/delete/update

  select($table_name, $where, $option)
    select row(s). parameter is the same as select method in SQL::Maker. But
    array ref for filed names are not needed. In array context, this method
    behaves the same as select_all. In scalar context, this method behaves
    the same as select_one

  select_row($table_name, $where, $option)
    select only one row. parameter is the same as select method in
    SQL::Maker. But array ref for filed names are not needed. this method
    returns hash ref and it is the same as return value in DBI's
    selectrow_hashref/fetchrow_hashref.

  select_all($table_name, $where, $option)
    select all rows. parameter is the same as select method in SQL::Maker.
    But array ref for filed names are not needed. this method returns array
    that is composed of hash refs. (hash ref is same as DBI's
    selectrow_hashref/fetchrow_hashref).

  select_named($sql, $params_href)
    select row(s). In array context, this method behaves the same as
    select_all_with_fields. In scalar context, this method behaves the same
    as select_one_with_fileds

    You can use named placeholder in SQL like this,

      my $ex = SQL::Executor->new($dbh);
      my $row = $ex->select_named("SELECT * FROM SOME_TABLE WHERE id = :id", { id => 1234 });

  select_row_named($sql, $params_href)
    select only one row. You can use named placeholder in SQL like this,

      my $ex = SQL::Executor->new($dbh);
      my $row = $ex->select_row_named("SELECT * FROM SOME_TABLE WHERE id = :id", { id => 1234 });

    this method returns hash ref and it is the same as return value in DBI's
    selectrow_hashref/fetchrow_hashref.

  select_all_named($sql, $params_href)
    select all rows. You can use named placeholder in SQL like this,

      my $ex = SQL::Executor->new($dbh);
      my @rows = $ex->select_all_named("SELECT * FROM SOME_TABLE WHERE id = :id", { id => 1234 });

    this method returns array that is composed of hash refs. (hash ref is
    same as DBI's selectrow_hashref/fetchrow_hashref).

  select_by_sql($sql, @binds)
    select row(s). In array context, this method behaves the same as
    select_all_with_fields. In scalar context, this method behaves the same
    as select_one_with_fileds

      my $ex = SQL::Executor->new($dbh);
      my $row = $ex->select_by_sql("SELECT * FROM SOME_TABLE WHERE id = ?", 1234);

  select_row_by_sql($sql, @binds)
    select only one row.

      my $ex = SQL::Executor->new($dbh);
      my $row = $ex->select_row_by_sql("SELECT * FROM SOME_TABLE WHERE id = ?", 1234);

    this method returns hash ref and it is the same as return value in DBI's
    selectrow_hashref/fetchrow_hashref.

  select_all_by_sql($sql, @binds)
    select all rows.

      my $ex = SQL::Executor->new($dbh);
      my @rows = $ex->select_all_by_sql("SELECT * FROM SOME_TABLE WHERE id = ?", 1234);

    this method returns array that is composed of hash refs. (hash ref is
    same as DBI's selectrow_hashref/fetchrow_hashref).

  select_with_fields($table_name, $fields_aref, $where, $option)
    select row(s). parameter is the same as select method in SQL::Maker. In
    array context, this method behaves the same as select_all_with_fields.
    In scalar context, this method behaves the same as
    select_one_with_fileds

  select_row_with_fields($table_name, $fields_aref, $where, $option)
    select only one row. parameter is the same as select method in
    SQL::Maker. this method returns hash ref and it is the same as return
    value in DBI's selectrow_hashref/fetchrow_hashref.

  select_all_with_fields($table_name, $fields_aref, $where, $option)
    select all rows. parameter is the same as select method in SQL::Maker.
    But array ref for filed names are not needed. this method returns array
    that is composed of hash refs. (hash ref is same as DBI's
    selectrow_hashref/fetchrow_hashref).

  insert($table_name, $values)
    Do INSERT statement. parameter is the same as select method in
    SQL::Maker.

  insert_multi($table_name, @args)
    Do INSERT-multi statement using SQL::Maker::Plugin::InsertMulti.

  delete($table_name, $where)
    Do DELETE statement. parameter is the same as select method in
    SQL::Maker.

  update($table_name, $set, $where)
    Do UPDATE statement. parameter is the same as select method in
    SQL::Maker.

  execute_query($sql, @binds)
    execute query and returns statement handler($sth).
